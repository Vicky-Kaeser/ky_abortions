As a daughter, a mother, a sister, a wife, a granddaughter, and a woman I want to share this data with you and with as many people as possible. Please share this valuable information wherever possible.

## Who is having abortions in Kentucky?

This data shows a different picture from what antiabortion individuals would like you to believe.
Ten years of data from 2009 to 2019 (2017 data was not available) is documented within seven data sets in this project (with the exception of the ethnicity table).
An additional data set shows reproductive health and rights under attack by the law makers in Kentucky   

## Age Groups Data Findings:   
The highest number of abortions are among women ages 20 to 29 years old according to the data.
Women suffer harrasment and discrimination for seeking abortions at any age and although studies only name women as those seeking abortions consider groups like transgender and nonconforming individuals who become pregnant and also seek abortions. Let's consider the mental anguish and trauma these "women" are put through.   

## Gestation | Weeks Data Findings:
The findings are higher number of abortions are happening at or less than the eight week of gestation. Furthermore, the data indicates  a major decline of abortions past the thirteenth week of gestation. It is difficult to understand why we need more court cases against 24 weeks abortions, since the numbers of abortions at this gestation level is so low. Do you know some unviable pregnancies have been labeled abortions? Laws are already affecting ectopic pregnancies.   

## Ethnicity Data Findings:
The data indicates white women are having the highest number of abortions among all other ethnic groups. A high number of white republican women are antiabortion proponents.   

## Marital Status Data Findings:
Data shows unmarried women are more likely to have an abortion. We must keep in mind that some of those unmarried women might have a partner. But we cannot dismiss the hardships for single women when it comes to the possibilities of raising a child on their own.   

## Method Data Findings:
The data shows the surgical procedures were more common in the earlier years but a transition to the medical procedure is very apparent. This is possibly due to better medications, but even these safe medications are under attack. Who can prescribe them, who can receive them, and even how to deliver them is becoming a court case.   

## Previous Live Births Data Findings:
The larger proportion of women who had abortions did not have prior live births and the second largest portion had a one prior live birth. Who are we to judge how many children a women should or should not have.   

## Previous Abortions Data Findings:
Women who had abortions had no prior abortions or had one previous abortion. The myth that women are having abortion after abortion is now demystified with
data.     

## Opposing Laws Data Findings: 
The number of House Bills, Senate Bills, and court cases against a medical procedure known as abortion is overwhelming and costly. The Trigger Law, a law set in place just in case another law gets overturned. Or, House Bill 91, which will be on the ballot this coming November will try to change Kentucky's Constitution and if it passes Kentucky will be a no right to abortion state.  I urge you to listen to the podcast listed here and read the resources and educate yourself in the case you or someone else might need assistance in the near future.

### Conclusion

## Who is having abortions in Kentucky?

A "women" between 20 and 29 years old, she is most likely white, she is not married, she either had one previous live birth or none, she either had one prior abortion or no prior abortions, the gestation period could be between less or equal to eight weeks or nine to thirteen weeks gestation, and the method could be medical. These are prior facts, today we live in a different world regarding women's rights. Women lost ground because of Covid-19, how much more does this state want from women?
