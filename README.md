# ky_abortions


As a daughter, a mother, a sister, a wife, a granddaughter, and a woman I want to share this data with you and with as many people as possible. Please share this valuable information wherever possible.

## Who is having abortions in Kentucky?

This data shows a different picture from what antiabortion individuals would like you to believe.
Ten years of data from 2009 to 2019 (2017 data was not available) is documented within seven data sets in this project (with the exception of the ethnicity table).
An additional data set shows reproductive health and rights under attack by the law makers in Kentucky.
